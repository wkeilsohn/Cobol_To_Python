## Run Cobol With Python

A Python script that (hopefully) will allow the user to run COBOL from the command line. 

# Limitations

Due to the nature of this kind of project, there are inevitably some things that cannot be reasonably accomplished. As such, here are the rules and assumptions for the project:

- There is only one COBOL file.
- The COBOL file is formated as a .cob file.
- The COBOL file does not use the LINKAGE SECTION.
- The COBOL file is written in all capital letters.

# Installing

This application is written in python (Version 3). Installing it should be as easy as running any other python application of a similar version on your machine.

A final requierments.txt file will also be included.

# Use 

As noted, the main use of this application is to allow the user to run a COBOL application from the command line.

# Lisence

Standard MIT.
